edison_sdl contains the code that manages the Edison Jr. board visual representation.

So far, I have edison_sdl and edison_led set up.
All other peripherals will follow a similar setup to the edison_led files, with a similar additions to the edison_sdl .c/.h files.

the struct edison_board contains information for managing the list of LEDs/switches/buttons/etc that are added to the board, and functions are or will be in the files for rendering each type of peripheral, which is in turn called by edison_render()
