Commenting

Block Style:
/*
 * This type of commenting will be used to describe many lines of code
 * like functions or complex algorithm. Sentences will be written with 
 * traditional capitalization and punctuation.
 *
 */

Critical-Line:
/*
 * The next line (or the comment itself) is important
 */

Next-Line:
/* Short description of next line. Nothing important to note */

In-Line:
// Used to comment out a certain line to debug or short description

Naming Conventions

Variable names should clearly describe what their values mean:
int counter = 0;

Use and "_" to separate words when naming long variables or functions:
void increment_counter(int counter);

A variable and function name should be completely lowercase:
void create_new_button();

Constants will be in all-caps:
#define MEMORY_ADDRESS 0x4000

Single letter variables exceptions:
"i", "j", and "k" are loop counters or temporary array indexes
"x", "y", and "z" are coordinate values

Boolean variables should be named to reflect the true condition

Function names should describe what the function does:
void print_list();
int convert_to_decimal(int binary_number);

Files

A header file will have the the same base filename as an associated source file

Header files should never define functions or variables

Header files should only #inlcude what is necessary to allow a file that
includes it to compile. Associated source files will always #include the
header of the same name, but should #include files whose resources are used
within the source even if they are already included in that header.

Formatting

Block statements encapsulated with braces should place the opening brace on
the next line and the closing brace at the same column position as the 
beginning of the conditional statement and opening brace.

if(led_is_on)
{
    statement1;
}

void count_char(arg1)
{
    statement1;
}

Conditional statements (such as if, else, while, for, switch, etc) should 
always be followed by a block statement, even if they contain only one line
statement.
